    question: 'What does Rubrion do?',
    answer:
      'IT consulting that builds, ships, and operates software for SMBs. Engagements blend whitelabel products (EdgeLetter newsletter, Rubrion Store marketplace) with bespoke integrations, delivered on Kubernetes and Terraform. SaaS deployment available when clients want it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast can Rubrion deliver?',
    answer:
      'Standard consulting engagements ship in 6-10 weeks end to end. Discovery and architecture take 1-2 weeks, infrastructure provisioning is automated and runs in 1 week, product setup and integration take 2-4 weeks, customization extends 2-4 weeks more, and final QA + go-live adds 1 week before production handover.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the pricing model?',
    answer:
      'Rubrion charges a fixed-fee consulting engagement plus infrastructure passthrough. There are no per-seat fees, no proprietary licensing, and no penalty for offboarding. Pricing scales with infrastructure footprint — when usage grows, only the underlying cloud bill grows with it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do clients get source access?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Most Rubrion projects ship as open repositories under github.com/rubrion (EdgeLetter, Rubrion Store, etc.). Bespoke work is delivered with full source ownership to the client. Clients can fork, self-host, or migrate operations in-house at any time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What kinds of projects does Rubrion take on?',
    answer:
      'Whitelabel newsletters, whitelabel marketplaces, custom web platforms, third-party integrations, and managed Kubernetes operations. IoT and wireless sensor network work goes through sister org Mondesa (mondesa.org).',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which technologies does Rubrion use?',
    answer:
      'The platform runs on Kubernetes with Terraform for infrastructure-as-code. Products are built on mature, community-driven foundations and exposed via API-first interfaces. Deployments run on any major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) and integrate with standard observability, identity, and CI/CD tooling.',
